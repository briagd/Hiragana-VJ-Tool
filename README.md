# Hiragana-VJ-Tool

VJ project made using Processing and Wekinator.
Hiraganas are displayed and shifted accross the screen using different trigonometric functions.

The program is controlled using a ps4 controller using the game control plus library for processing. 
The different parameters are mapped between the ps4 controller and the processing sketch using Wekinator and machine learning algorithms.

The two processing sketches must be run at the same time as well as wekinator. The trained model on wekinator is included in the folder: ps4ToLetters - Wekinator. But the model can trained for other inputs.
